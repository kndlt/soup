# Phase 4.3

Let's look at [Eulerian fluid simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKAVRgIrUOU).

And see if we can implement something like that.

## Topics that I need to cover

- [ ] [Matthias Müller’s Ten Minute Physics](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/index.html)
- [ ] MPM
- [ ] GPU Gems 2 Chap. 38 “Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games” (free online)
- [ ] Fluid net seems similar (https://github.com/google/FluidNet)
- [ ] TaiChi seems like the most closest contender.
- [ ] Or that's going to get me into this topic too much, and I won't be able to come out.
- [ ] I need something that is simple.
