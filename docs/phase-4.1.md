# Phase 4.1

In previous phase, we studied the current state of the codebase, and studied how tree cells behave.

We decided to move the tree simulation to 3D grid in Pytorch. Each iteration all nodes will be updated.

To make this happen, we will move out the index.html and soup.js file.

Then, start a new pytorch project.
